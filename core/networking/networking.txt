HOW to run node js
In Windows, you need to set node.js folder path into system variables or user variables.

1) open Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables

2) in "User variables" or "System variables" find variable PATH and add node.js folder path as value. Usually it is C:\Program Files\nodejs;. If variable doesn't exists, create it.

3) Restart your IDE or computer.

It is useful add also "npm" and "Git" paths as variable, separated by semicolon.
